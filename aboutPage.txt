Create a section with two-thirds of a column left and 1 third in the right 
on a white background.
In the left column place the following text: 

"DoodleKids Salon is a trendy modern kids’ salon, located in Wierda Park, Centurion.
 We are dedicated to providing the best kids’ salon experience ever! Our kid friendly 
stylists are trained to treat our little clients with absolute care and patience, 
using quality child safe products and gentle hands. The salon prides itself in catering
 for all types of hair and ethnicity, specialising in hair cutting, plaiting, braiding, 
treatments, dreadlocks and so much more.

At DoodleKids Salon, we have a waiting area for parents and a waiting lounge for 
kids where they can choose to either read a book, play with the variety of educational 
toys and games or tap into their creative side by drawing or colouring in. DoodleKids
 also has a shuttle service for those times when parents are tied up.

You already know that aching scalps and painful hairdos are not part of the 5 senses 
that your little one should experience. So why have you not added us to your favourite 
contacts yet?

We take appointments to ensure that there is no waiting time for service, however, 
walk-ins are welcome and will be attended to."




In the right column create a purple block with the following details:

"Working Hours
Please note: On Sundays & Public Holidays we are open from 09:00 - 15:00

Monday		CLOSED
Tuesday		9 AM - 5 PM

Below the last day, place a yellow button, with a call to action "Contact Us" to 
phone our client.


Over the entire streach now add a section with a blue background and ad the 
following text inside:
Heading "Book your appointment today!"
Subscript "Join us at our comfortable and fun filled Salon…"
Place a Call to action button with text "CALL TO BOOK"


End page with Top and Bottom Footers.
